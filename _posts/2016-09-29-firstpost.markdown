## KcEMA ReLaunch ##

As president, I'm excited to announce the full ReLaunch of KcEMA. Our first program, the ReLaunch Part at La Esquina was a great success. Special thanks to [Mnemosyne](http://www.mnemosynequartet.com/) and [Ensemble of Irreproduceable Outcomes](https://www.facebook.com/EIOmusic) for joining us for a great evening.

We look forward to even more concerts, community engagement, and collaborations over the next year. We are also working on transforming our website, and expanding our online presence. Keep watching our site, our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/KCEMAlliance/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KCEMAlliance). 

Thanks for dropping by, 

John Chittum
KcEMA President
